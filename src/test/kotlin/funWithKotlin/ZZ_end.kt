# Takeaway
[.build-lists: true]

* [Kotlin is not a strictly functional language]
* But support for first class functions is very good
* Allowing objects to implement function types allows productive mixing of OO and FP techniques
* Data oriented design is encouraged by extension functions, allowing us to pass around typed data and define operations in local contexts
* Features combine in interesting ways to allow terse but expressive code

# That was fun?
