Introduce me
I'm really just the warmup act for Dmitry
Actually I sent him a message to ask him if I could go second, on the grounds that after you've seen his excellent talk you won't remember mine
and also his talk is on Kotlin Native, so what is it doing in the first JVM in London meeting?
He sent me back this note, it says "You can't"
Explain that the Kotlin keyword defining an executable block of code is fun
Quick poll to gauge audience experience with Java, Kotlin, Scala, other languages
