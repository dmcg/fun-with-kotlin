# Fun with Kotlin

A presentation to the [JVM in London](https://www.meetup.com/JVM-in-London/events/264157116/) group on the many types
of functions in Kotlin.

The code is all in here, processed into Markdown by the code from [My First Book Project](https://github.com/dmcg/episodes)
and rendered into PDF by [DeckSet](http:://deckset.com). 

See the [slides as PDF](fun-with-kotlin.pdf).
